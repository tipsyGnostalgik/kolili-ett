Something that started as a small edit now turned into a project to make Etterna really pretty!

# WARNING:
This is the **Working** tree, it has an UNFINISHED song select and you should download the file from RELEASES instead of cloning due to the PlayerCards.

I still have quite the To-Do list, so please take the current pre-release not as that, but as a really small taste of what I want.

## To-do:
* ~~Fix Online functions (Really far off, HUGE priority.)~~ I downloaded the wrong SCWH version accidentally but i'll keep this to remind everyone i'm a FUCKING IDIOT
* Revamp Music Select (Far off, High priority.)
* Add symbols to the main theme font (Done, on Working.)
* Revamp Stage Clear and Failed (Doable, High priority.)
* Add Anti-Alias to Logo on transition (Doable, I'm just lazy.)
* Avoid stretching on 4:3 (Doable, High priority.)

# Title Screens
These were really fun to make, they normally shuffle but I'll add an option to choose the one you want.
